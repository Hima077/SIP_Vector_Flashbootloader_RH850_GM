## Getting Started

To get started with the SIP Vector Flashbootloader, you will need to download the latest release. You can find the release files [here](https://github.com/Hima077/SIP_Vector_Flashbootloader_RH850_GM/releases). Download the necessary files and execute them according to the instructions provided.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A compatible RH850 microcontroller
- Development environment set up for embedded C programming
- Access to a CAN bus interface

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hima077/SIP_Vector_Flashbootloader_RH850_GM.git
   cd SIP_Vector_Flashbootloader_RH850_GM
   ```

2. **Download Releases**: Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Hima077/SIP_Vector_Flashbootloader_RH850_GM/releases) section to download the necessary files.

3. **Set Up Environment**: Configure your development environment to include the required libraries and dependencies.

4. **Compile the Code**: Use your preferred compiler to build the project.

## Usage

Once you have installed the flash bootloader, you can use it in your project. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement the bootloader in your application.

### Example Code

```c
#include "flashbootloader.h"

void main() {
    // Initialize the bootloader
    Bootloader_Init();

    // Check for incoming data
    if (Bootloader_ReceiveData()) {
        // Process the received data
        Bootloader_ProcessData();
    }

    // Finalize the bootloading process
    Bootloader_Finalize();
}
```

This example demonstrates how to initialize the bootloader, receive data, and process it. Adjust the implementation according to your specific application needs.
